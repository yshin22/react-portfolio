Portfolio Website using React

Project Discription:

This is a personal website created using React, Sass and HTML. It was created as a way to learn React, to become familiar with front end Web-development and to display my work in progress resume. It is FAR from being a complete website as it lacks dynamic functionalities and styling. This is a start!
